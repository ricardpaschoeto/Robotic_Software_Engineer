# Robotic_Software_Engineer

This Nanodegree is a part of my ROS path learning going deepth in Robotics and related algorithms and improve my self.

## Motivation

Robotics will be the most important technology in industry 4.0. It's a multidisciplinary and fascinating field that joins control, mechatronics, applied math, and Computation engineering. The opportunities to develop in the industry and academic environment are enthusiastic. I hope to work in this fascinating field as soon as possible.
